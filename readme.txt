Short description: 
This interface allows you to add compatibility to Pentagon 128 programs on Pentagon 48 computers. For the memory
expansion exchange the DRAMs on board with 256K*1 DRAMs and follow the instructions in the .pdf. Modifications to
the mainboard of the computer are described in the .pdf
The value of C1 changes dependant on the type of logic IC used (74/74LS/74ALS/155/555/1533)
If you don't need the Kempston interface (it's redundant if the 8255 is used) you can leave out IC11, RN1, JP1.
MIKAY stands for "Mem - INT - Kempston - AY"

Enjoy!
