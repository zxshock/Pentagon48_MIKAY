Daughterboard to add support for 128K RAM, adjust INT and timing. Additionally add support for AY-3-8910.
Also features a circuit to add support for Kempston Joystick on Port #31 which is redundant and should *NOT* be populated. Kept for historical purposes or rather because I don't want to redo the layout, which is why I'm including Eagle .sch and .brd files.
Documentation needs some touch-ups for be more clear what to lift/cut and when to attach signals.
